# AdSmart
*Spice up your ads with smart and creative prompts from AdSmart.*

AdSmart is a powerful tool that generates advertisement prompts based on the keywords you provide. With AdSmart, you can easily create targeted and effective advertisements that will help you reach your audience. Whether you need a slogan for your product, a headline for your blog post, or a tagline for your social media campaign, AdSmart can help you find the best words to attract your audience.


## How it works
AdSmart takes as an input your `product/service information`, a list of `keywords` that describe your product or service, additionally, specific information such as the `length` of the prompts. Our advanced algorithm based on the `Chat GPT python API` will generate a list of advertisement prompts for you to choose from. You can explore one of the prompts and get a new list of options. Finally, you can select the one that best fits your needs, do your own customization (editing) and and start advertising smarter with AdSmart.
